## Contributing

You need NodeJS 20.16.0 or later and npm 10.8.1 or later installed.

Javascript linting, compressing and LESS compilation is handled through Gulp.
Therefore, please run `gulp` instead of changing compressed CSS/JS manually.
Default Gulp task will also check the code using ESLint.

Installing build dependencies:

```
npm install
```
